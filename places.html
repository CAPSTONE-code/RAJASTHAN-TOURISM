                    A walled town surrounded (except to the south) by hills, the city was founded in
                    1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh to replace nearby Amber (now Amer, a part of
                    Jaipur) as the capital of the princely state of Jaipur (founded by the Rajputs in
                    the 12th century CE). Jaipur grew dramatically in size in the late 20th and early
                    21st centuries, doubling its population between 1991 and 2011. It has a mixed
                    Hindu-Muslim population. The city was the site of numerous bombing attacks in
                    the early 21st century, with mosques and Hindu temples being targets.

                    <span class="namespan">Jaisalmer, </span> town, western Rajasthan state, northwestern India. It is
                    situated on a
                    level plain in the Thar (Great Indian) Desert, about 135 miles (215 km) northwest
                    of Jodhpur. <br>
                    <br>
                    The town, noted for its buildings of yellowish brown stone, was founded in 1156 by
                    Rawal Jaisal, a chief of the Rajputs (the warrior rulers of the historic region of
                    Rajputana). In the 12th century Jaisalmer state reached the height of its power.
                    After the sack of the capital by the Muslim Delhi sultan ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Khaljī early in
                    the 14th century, its fortunes declined. It subsequently became a Mughal fiefdom
                    and entered into political relations with the British in 1818. In 1949 it joined the
                    state of Rajasthan. <br>

                    <br>
                    The city was the capital of the former princely state of Bikaner. About 1465 Rao
                    Bika, a Rajput chieftain of the Rathor clan, began to conquer the area from other
                    Rajput clans. In 1488 he began building the city of Bikaner (“the settlement of
                    Bika”). He died in 1504, and his successors gradually extended their possessions.
                    The state adhered loyally to the Mughal emperors, who ruled in Delhi from 1526 to
                    1857. Rai Singh, who succeeded as chieftain of Bikaner in 1571 and ruled until 1612,
                    became one of the emperor Akbar’s most-distinguished generals and was named
                    the first raja of Bikaner.

                    outpost. Over time, a township grew around the fort and soon attracted a large community of
                    traders, who then settled down at Mandawa.[4][5] The great Ghazal Singer of South Asia Mehdi
                    Hassan was born here and migrated to Pakistan after the partition of India. <br>
                    <br>
                    The town of Mandawa is known as the "Open Art Gallery" as a whole. During the 18th
                    century, Mandawa was a key stop for wealthy merchants travelling the Silk Road. The
                    majority of them chose to build their homes in this town, resulting in the creation of a plethora
                    of exquisitely crafted large Havelis that are popular tourist attractions in Mandawa.[6] Many
                    Bollywood films like PK (film), Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil among others are shot
                    here.

                            northwestern India. It is situated in a
                            gorge surrounded by forested hills on which stand several palaces and forts. <br>
                            Bundi is said to have been named for Bunda, a 13th-century chieftain. The original
                            princely state of Bundi was known as Haraoti. It came under British paramountcy
                            as a result of a treaty in 1818 and became part of the state of Rajasthan in 1948.

                    princely state of Bundi (established in the 14th century by the Rajputs), and its
                    palaces are noted for their distinctive “Bundi-style” frescoes. A college in Bundi is

                    The town is a noted hill resort, and the Jaina temples built of marble at nearby
                    Dilwara are famous. Tejpal temple, built about 1200 CE, is known for the delicacy
                    and richness of its carving, especially for that on the underside of its dome. The
                    earlier Vimala Vasahi temple, built about 1031, is simpler and bolder in style. Abu
                    was the headquarters of the Rajputana Agency during the British rule of India; it
                    now has a police-training college. Guru Peak on Mount Abu (5,650 feet [1,722
